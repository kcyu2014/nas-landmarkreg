    """Computes the number of channels at every vertex.

    Given the input channels and output channels, this calculates the number of
    channels at each interior vertex. Interior vertices have the same number of
    channels as the max of the channels of the vertices it feeds into. The output
    channels are divided amongst the vertices that are directly connected to it.
    When the division is not even, some vertices may receive an extra channel to
    compensate.

    Args:
      input_channels: input channel count.
      output_channels: output channel count.
      matrix: adjacency matrix for the module (pruned by model_spec).

    Returns:
      list of channel counts, in order of the vertices.
